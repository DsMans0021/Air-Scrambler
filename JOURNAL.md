## 10/27/2025 - Searching  

At first, I hated AI cuz it didn't help.
I searched for the components I should have brought to create the device.
What I will need:

1. Raspberry Pi 5 as a microcontroller
2. 2 Breadboards and Jumpers ... Lots of jumpers
3. 4 pieces of NRF24 
4. ELECROW 10.1-Inch Resistive Touch Screen
5. Lubed switches and Keycaps
6. 3D printed Case for all of this stuff

I guess there is more to remember, but for now, it's good ...... Maybe
